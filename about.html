        Lillian was born in <time datetime="1904">1904</time> and lived to
        <span class="nowrap">104&nbsp;years</span>. She learned to cook from her
        mother and grandmother, survived two world wars, and raised a family
        through frugality, home-grown food, and traditional values.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her legacy inspires this site—helping modern families rediscover the
        timeless habits that truly nourish us.
