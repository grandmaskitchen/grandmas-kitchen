    <p>
      Lillian was born in <time datetime="1904">1904</time> and lived to 
      <span class="nowrap">104&nbsp;years</span>. She learned to cook from her
      mother and grandmother, survived two world wars, and raised a family
      through frugality, home-grown food, and traditional values.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her legacy inspires this site—helping modern families rediscover
      the timeless habits that truly nourish us.
